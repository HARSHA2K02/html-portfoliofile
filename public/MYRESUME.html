            <li><h4>ANTI SLEEP ALARM</h4></li>
            <P>The main aim of an anti-sleep alarm using an IR sensor in spectacles is to detect when the wearer is
                becoming drowsy or falling asleep, and to alert them to wake up and stay alert. This type of system is
                particularly useful for drivers, as drowsy driving is a significant risk factor for accidents on the road. By
                detecting signs of drowsiness and alerting the driver to stay alert, an anti-sleep alarm can help to prevent
                accidents and keep the driver and others on the road safe.</P>
            <li><h4>EMAIL ALERTS ON WHATSAPP</h4></li>
            <p>The main purpose of this project is to design an automation bot using whatsapp where we can view our
                mails and also can send mails consisting text reading mails in whatsapp is much easier because we spend
                most of the time in whatsapp and not switching to another app can save time and also facilitates in user
                flexibility. in this we use Twillo software for the email retreival and email searching.</p>
            <li><h4>SOFTWARE BUG PREDICTION</h4></li>
            <P>The main aim of this project is to identify the Software bugs and errors at initial stages of Software
                Development. Here we use the historical datasets, where the bugs and errors that occur while developing
                the software. By applying the Machine Learning models we can identify its errors and bugs. This will
                improve the software quality, reliability, reduce development and maintainance costs and improve</P>
